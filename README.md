# SCLM App Preview

This is a small Vite + React + TypeScript preview project for the SCLM mobile shell UI.

How to run (Windows PowerShell):

```powershell
cd "C:\Users\CFKJ\Documents\App SCLM\preview-app"
npm install
npm run dev
```

Open the local URL shown by Vite (usually http://localhost:5173) to see the preview.

Notes:
- Tailwind is configured; the UI uses Tailwind classes. If you want additional Tailwind plugins (e.g., line-clamp), install them.
- `src/App.tsx` is copied from your file. Adjust as needed.
